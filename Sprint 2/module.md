Name: Jonathan Leonardson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 2

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |

|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    -Variables
    -Expressions
    -Conditionals
    -Loops
    -Functions

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
-Youtube Tutorials
-Rust Official Sites https://www.rust-lang.org/
-The background of Rust https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

-I would like to spend more time during this sprint to do more research and background of the language itself so I can furthur understand the syntax.
-Then I want to start practicing the syntax and the code by watching tutorials and coding along with them.
-Then Start working on my project bit by bit and taking time to learn and grow when I run into road blocks.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
-I am hoping to use vs Code in showing my rust project!


4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
-I want to continue my schedule of 2-4 monday through frinday working on the project.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
-Procrastinating simple lines of Code. I am hoping that this sprint I will take the time to make sure I write the needed code and fix the bugs.
-Time management, although I set time aside sometimes things come up and it becomes hard to manage. So plan ahead to be more flexible with my time schedule.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/FlyEmris/CSE-310/tree/main/Sprint%202

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1u0E-3zKyw&feature=youtu.be

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   Yes  |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   Yes  |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   No   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   Yes  |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   Yes  |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge. 

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|12 Hours           |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

Taking time to set up my enviroment during the start of the sprint was a great sucess. It allowed me to fix any issues I had earlier on.
Learning th esyntax was a bit tricky especially looping. I kept running into errors and lost a bunch of time trying to understand them.
I would like to next time ask for help and find people who could guide me through a process such as that so I won't spend so much time running into the same error.
