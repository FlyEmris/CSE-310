## Overview

**Project Title**: Wordle

**Project Description**: A word guessing game.

**Project Goals**: Work on my code earlier and not hold off on a couple lines of code. So that I won't run into any bugs at the last moment.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download Rust from web (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Build a new crate with the terminal (cargo new my_crate)
3. Navigate to the directory of the crate you built (cd my_crate)
4. Write your code.
5. to run the code in the terminal if you are in the directory of the crate. (cargo run)

Instructions for using the software:

1. I used vscode.
2. open the file or directory of the code.
3. In the terminal simply put (cargo run)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Understand looping better and add components so the code won't quit if you messed up.
* [ ] Add more elements to make the guessing game more exciting.
