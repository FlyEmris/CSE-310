# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Jonathan Leonardson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? = 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |        X      |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    -   Display output to the screen using format.
    -   Pattern Matching in function parameters.
    -   Recursion
    -   Guards
    -   Lists
    -   Using lambda functions with lists:map, lists:filter, or   lists: fold
    

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRrfc9CiR_s&list=PLdOYTlKwc71ljrfUqrKYoULxRjqI0p8it - youtube
    - https://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/seq_prog - Erlang Getting Started pdf
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming - Erlang Wikipedia

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    - I plan on writting out the code when I watch video's on youtube. And when I read documentation about the language I will have a notebook and take notes on different functionalities the programming language has. Find unique tips or tools that will also help out in the long run.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    - I plan on using Vscode and youtube for my video.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    - I will work Monday - Saturday at my apartment or the stc from 2 - 4.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    - This is a new language so I will run into errors with Erlang running the shell. I will take time and practice patience with practicing using the shell and finding help from videos or Ai online, and If I get stuck I will seek help from my Professor or TA's.
    - I also get fairly distracted at times so I will also allow myself short 5 minute breaks every 30 minutes to stretch and to walk around a bit to help my mind refocus.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/8RbQJ1N2vQc

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |        |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    X   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |    X   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    X   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    X   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge. 
I added a bit of recursion in my code.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
I did not change my module during the sprint.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|12 hours 30 minutes|

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
Setting time aside to work on the project really helped me quite a bit. It helped me focus and know that I set apart that time to work on my sprint. 
I think next sprint I would like to use more resources either online or in person to help learn the language or software better.
